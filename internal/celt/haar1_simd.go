// minHaar1ButterflyStride is the comb width at and above which haar1's add/sub
// butterfly routes through i32.Butterfly (via haar1WideButterfly); narrower
// combs keep the inlined scalar loop. The crossover is set from a clean pinned
// benchstat on both arches, not from the library's own SIMD-activation length:
// i32.Butterfly first beats the inlined scalar butterfly here only once a comb
// spans two or more vector blocks. At stride 16 (two AVX2 int32 blocks on amd64,
// four NEON blocks on arm64) it wins clearly, roughly -17% on amd64 and -19% on
// arm64. At stride 8 (one AVX2 block) the per-comb call plus a single block is
// break-even to slightly negative on amd64 (about +3%) and only a marginal win
// on arm64 (about -2%), so 8 does not carry its weight as a single
// arch-independent gate and stays scalar. Production reaches strides 16, 32 and
// beyond through the time-resolution recombine loops (haar1(X, N_B, B) with B
// doubling, and haar1(X, N0>>k, 1<<k)), so the wide-stride path serves real
// calls. Strides below the gate run byte-identical scalar code; any movement on
// them in a microbenchmark is pure code-alignment noise, not a real change.

// haar1 is the CELT Hadamard/Haar step (bands.c:623), the SIMD-backed form of
// haar1Generic (haar1_ref.go). The per-element 1/sqrt(2) scale is the expensive
// part (a 32x32 -> Q31 multiply run twice per pair); it is hoisted out of the
// comb loop into a single vectorized i32.ScaleQ31 pass over the whole touched
// region. The wrapping add/sub butterfly then runs per comb through i32.Butterfly
// when the comb is wide enough to reach the vector kernel
// (stride >= minHaar1ButterflyStride) and stays a scalar inlined loop below that.
//
// Bit-exactness. i32.ScaleQ31 computes int32(int64(a[i]) * int64(k) >> 31), the
// integer MULT32_32_Q31: a truncating (arithmetic, no rounding) Q31 multiply
// that wraps in int32, identical to fixedmath.MULT32_32_Q31 for every input (the
// multiply is commutative, so scaling by sqrt2Inv31 on either operand is the
// same value). ScaleQ31 documents exact element-for-element aliasing, so the
// in-place dst==src scale is defined. Scaling every touched element up front and
// combining afterwards yields the same values as haar1Generic's interleaved
// order, because the scale is elementwise and carries no dependency into the
// add/sub. i32.Butterfly writes lo[i], hi[i] = lo[i]+hi[i], lo[i]-hi[i] with
// two's-complement wrapping int32 adds and subtracts, exactly ADD32/SUB32 per
// lane with no saturation, reading both lanes before writing either; evens and
// odds are the disjoint halves [0,stride) and [stride,2*stride) of one comb, so
// they satisfy i32.Butterfly's no-overlap contract and the stride gate selects
// between two implementations of the same arithmetic (a codegen choice, never a
// value change). The differential proof over the (N0, stride) matrix, the int32
// wrapping edges, and fuzz is TestHaar1SIMDMatchesScalar / TestHaar1SIMDExtremes
// / FuzzHaar1 in haar1_simd_test.go.
