// Codec scratch pool. libopus takes every per-frame working buffer off the C
// stack with VARDECL(x,n) / ALLOC(x,n,T) (alloca): free to obtain, reclaimed on
// frame pop. The transliteration mapped each ALLOC to a Go make(), which is a heap
// allocation: 501 objects and 145 KB per stereo 20 ms encode, 93 objects and 38 KB
// per stereo 20 ms decode. This file holds them on the Encoder and the Decoder
// instead, so a steady-state Encode or Decode allocates nothing. One scratch type
// serves both: a given codec instance only ever runs one side, so an encode field
// and a decode field never hold live data in the same scratch at the same time.
// Most decode-only buffers live in the "DECODE PATH" group at the end; the decode
// path ALSO draws on fields declared in the shared-function groups below, because
// the declaring C function runs on both sides: norm and hadamardTmp (quant_all_bands),
// bits1/bits2/thresh/trimOffset (clt_compute_allocation), and mdctF2 (the MDCT).
// Those six are part of the decode zeroing audit exactly like the dec* fields.
//
// THE ZEROING CONTRACT: the one thing that can silently break bit-exactness here.
// Three behaviours must not be confused:
//
//	C's stack ALLOC   is UNINITIALISED: it carries whatever the last stack frame left.
//	Go's make()       ZEROES.
//	A pooled buffer   carries THE PREVIOUS FRAME'S VALUES.
//
// Every site that draws from this scratch was audited to write its entire read
// window before reading it, which collapses those three behaviours into one. That
// is not luck: libopus is valgrind-clean, so a plain ALLOC it reads before writing
// would be reading uninitialised stack, and the codec would not be deterministic.
// The ENCODE sites where C does NOT rely on that keep an explicit clear at the
// point of use, and there are three:
//
//	offsets           C itself issues OPUS_CLEAR(offsets, nbEBands) (celt_encoder.c:1066),
//	                  so dynalloc_analysis re-initialises it on every call.
//	surround_dynalloc C issues OPUS_CLEAR(surround_dynalloc, end) (celt_encoder.c:2107).
//	importance        no OPUS_CLEAR in C, but its read window in tf_analysis exceeds
//	                  dynalloc_analysis' write window when start>0, so a pooled buffer
//	                  would read the previous frame there.
//
// Each is commented at its clear.
//
// THE DECODE PATH NEEDS NO CLEARS. The comment at celt_decoder.go's quantAllBands
// call once warned that the encoder audit above did NOT cover decode; this is that
// audit. Every decode buffer was checked the same way, and all of them write their
// entire read window before any read, so none needs a clear:
//
//	decIy             cwrsi (decode_pulses) fills all N before normalise_residual /
//	                  extract_collapse_mask read it.
//	decTfRes          tf_decode writes [start,end); quant_all_bands reads [start,end).
//	decCap            init_caps writes all nbEBands; only [start,end) is read.
//	decOffsets        the dynalloc loop writes [start,end); clt_compute_allocation
//	                  reads offsets[j] only for j in [start,end). Note C clears offsets
//	                  in the ENCODER (OPUS_CLEAR at celt_encoder.c:1066) but NOT in the
//	                  decoder: the decoder's read window never leaves the write window.
//	decFineQuant      }
//	decPulses         } outputs of clt_compute_allocation, written over [start,end),
//	decFinePriority   } read over [start,end) by the fine-energy / band / anti-collapse
//	                    passes.
//	decX              quant_all_bands writes every bin of bands [start,end); celt_synthesis
//	                  reads X only over [M*eBands[start], M*eBands[effEnd]) with effEnd<=end.
//	decCollapseMasks  each band writes collapse_masks[i*C..] as it finishes; the fold
//	                  reads only lower, already-written bands (foldI<i) and anti_collapse
//	                  reads [start,end). Intra-frame write-before-read.
//	decFreq           denormalise_bands writes all N (band bins, then OPUS_CLEAR to N).
//	mdctF2            clt_mdct_backward writes all N4 (bitrev is a permutation) before
//	                  the post-rotation reads them; shared with the forward MDCT, which a
//	                  Decoder never runs (Encoder and Decoder own separate scratch).
//	decDeemph         written [0,N) per channel before the downsample read (downsample>1).
//	                  Only allocated for sub-48 kHz output; TestDecoderScratchCarryover
//	                  decodes at 24 kHz so the poison run reaches it.
//	norm, hadamardTmp (shared with encode; declared in the quant_all_bands and
//	bits1, bits2,      Hadamard groups below) and the clt_compute_allocation
//	thresh, trimOffset quartet: on decode these follow the same [start,end)-bounded
//	                  write-before-read pattern as their encode use; norm's lowband
//	                  fill is contiguous from start, and rate.go writes bits1/bits2/
//	                  thresh/trimOffset over [start,end) before any read.
//
// This was not taken on trust: a poison pass that filled every pooled buffer with
// 0x5A before each decode call left the differential and conformance suites bit-exact.
//
// NOT SAFE FOR CONCURRENT USE, exactly like the Encoder or Decoder that owns it (one
// per goroutine, as documented on EncodeWithEC / DecodeWithEC). That is why the
// buffers need neither a mutex nor a sync.Pool: C gets the same isolation for free
// from having one stack per thread, and locking here would be pure overhead.

// The alloc helper (the Go stand-in for ALLOC(x, n, T)) lives in scratch_alloc.go;
// a build-tagged copy in scratch_poison.go fills each window with 0x5A under
// -tags poison, the read-before-write audit harness this file's contract rests on.
