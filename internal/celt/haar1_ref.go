// haar1Generic is haar1 (bands.c:haar1), the scalar reference and source of
// truth for the SIMD-backed haar1 in haar1_simd.go. It is the CELT Hadamard /
// Haar step: for each stride-wide comb the pair (evens[i], odds[i]) is scaled by
// 1/sqrt(2) in Q31 and replaced by its sum and difference.
//
// Like pitch_ref.go this file carries no build tag on purpose: it compiles into
// every build so TestHaar1SIMDMatchesScalar, TestHaar1SIMDExtremes and FuzzHaar1
// always have the reference to diff the library-backed haar1 against, sample for
// sample.
//
// Each output element is an independent MULT32_32_Q31 (a truncating 32x32 -> Q31
// multiply that wraps in int32) followed by a wrapping ADD32 / SUB32. There is
// no accumulation across elements, so unlike the pitch kernels there is no
// reassociation argument to make; the SIMD path wins its bit-exactness by
// computing the same per-element expression in the same order, not by regrouping.
//
// The loop is the comb-grouped form of the C double loop. For a given j the
// stride evens (index stride*2*j+i, i in [0,stride)) sit immediately next to the
// stride odds (index stride*(2*j+1)+i), so together they are one contiguous
// 2*stride comb at offset stride*2*j. Walking j as a shrinking window over that
// comb, and i as a plain range over the two halves, addresses every element the
// original double loop touches with the same values, just grouped by comb
// instead of by i; the two halves of a comb never depend on any other comb, so
// comb order cannot change the result. The exact-bound reslice to m*stride*2 is
// what lets bounds-check elimination prove the per-comb windows in range.
