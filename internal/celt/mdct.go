// Transliteration of libopus celt/mdct.c (v1.6.1, commit 3da9f7a6) for the
// frozen FIXED_POINT + DISABLE_FLOAT_API + non-QEXT configuration. The CELT
// decoder uses the inverse (backward) MDCT: pre-rotation of the frequency
// coefficients, an N/4-point complex FFT, post-rotation, and the weighted
// overlap-add mirroring for time-domain aliasing cancellation.
//
// The pre/post trig rotation reads the mode's int16 .trig table and the
// rounding-brittle S_MUL/PSHR32_ovflw macros; they are transliterated exactly
// (docs/peer-review.md section 7). The forward MDCT (encoder side) is the
// transpose of the backward one and lives in cltMDCTForward below.
