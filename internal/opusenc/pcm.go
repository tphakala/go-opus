package opusenc

// pcm.go is the PCM-DOMAIN FRONT END of opus_encode_frame_native
// (opus_encoder.c:1855): everything that happens to the caller's int16 samples
// between entering the encoder and handing a buffer to CELT, plus the two
// cross-frame buffers that front end owns (st->hp_mem and st->delay_buffer) and
// the stereo-width crossfade state (st->hybrid_stereo_width_Q14).
//
// The per-frame order is LOAD-BEARING and is spelled out in PCMFront /
// UpdateDelayBuffer / PCMFades below. In the C the three are separated by work
// that is either dead (the SILK block) or independent of the PCM buffers (the
// CELT ctl setup), which is why they can be split here without changing a bit.
//
// Frozen config: 48 kHz, OPUS_APPLICATION_AUDIO, forced MODE_CELT_ONLY,
// FIXED_POINT, no RES24 (so opus_res is opus_int16 and RES_SHIFT is 0), no QEXT.
// encoder_buffer = Fs/100 = 480, delay_compensation = Fs/250 = 192, so
// total_buffer = 192 and the delay-compensation ring is live.

	// power of two, so the product is EXACTLY 983.03997802734375; + 0.5 (double)
	// = 983.53997802734375; truncated to opus_int32 = 983. Reading the literal as
	// a double gives 983.04 + 0.5 = 983.54 -> 983 as well, so the two readings

	// unchanged FOR ANY c. No differential test in this configuration can
	// distinguish a wrong coefficient from a right one; what the differential
	// does prove is that the state is preserved exactly, which is what closes the
