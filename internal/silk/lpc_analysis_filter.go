// Transliteration of silk/LPC_analysis_filter.c (libopus v1.6.1). The FIXED_POINT
// oracle build compiles the reference path with USE_CELT_FIR == 0, so this port
// mirrors that scalar branch exactly (the celt_fir variant is a SIMD optimization,
// not the bit-exact reference). silk_decode_core's re-whitening step is the only
// decode-side caller. Names and control flow follow the C for diffability.

// order d) over in[0:length], writing the residual to out[0:length]. The filter
// starts with zero state; the first d output samples are set to zero. Wrap-around
// in the intermediate accumulator is intentional (silk_SMLABB_ovflw), so that two
// wraps can cancel; the rare wrap cases are only reachable from invalid streams.
