// Transliteration of silk/stereo_decode_pred.c (libopus v1.6.1): the range-decode
// side of the SILK stereo predictor. silk_stereo_decode_pred reads the two mid/side
// prediction weights pred_Q13[] the stereo un-mixing (silk_stereo_MS_to_LR) later
// applies, and silk_stereo_decode_mid_only reads the flag that the encoder coded only
// the mid channel. Both run once per packet, before the per-channel silk_decode_frame,
// off the same range decoder. Names, control flow and comments follow the C for
// diffability. The iCDF tables (silk_stereo_pred_joint_iCDF, silk_uniform3_iCDF,
// silk_uniform5_iCDF, silk_stereo_only_code_mid_iCDF) and the dequant codebook
// (silk_stereo_pred_quant_Q13) come from tables_gen.go.
