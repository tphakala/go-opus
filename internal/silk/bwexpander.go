// Transliteration of silk/bwexpander.c and silk/bwexpander_32.c (libopus v1.6.1)
// for the frozen FIXED_POINT + DISABLE_FLOAT_API build. Chirp (bandwidth expand)
// of an LP AR filter: Bwexpander operates on Q12 int16 coefficients (used after a
// packet loss on the decode path), Bwexpander32 on unscaled int32 coefficients
// (used inside silk_NLSF2A / silk_LPC_fit's stability loop). Names follow the C
// for diffability; all fixed-point math imports internal/silkmath.
