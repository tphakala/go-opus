// Transliteration of silk/sum_sqr_shift.c (libopus v1.6.1). Ported here as a
// helper for the SILK packet-loss concealment (silk/PLC.c silk_PLC_energy and
// silk_PLC_glue_frames call it). The intermediate accumulator is unsigned and the
// per-sample products are allowed to wrap (silk_SMLABB_ovflw), matching the C.
// Names and control flow follow the C for diffability.
