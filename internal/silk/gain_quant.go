// Transliteration of the decode-side gain dequantizer from silk/gain_quant.c
// (libopus v1.6.1): silk_gains_dequant reconstructs the linear per-subframe gains
// (Q16) from the decoded gain indices, carrying the previous quantized index
// (psDec.LastGainIndex) across subframes and frames. The encode-side
// silk_gains_quant / silk_gains_ID are not part of the decode path and are omitted.
// Names and control flow follow the C for diffability; fixed-point math imports
// internal/silkmath.
