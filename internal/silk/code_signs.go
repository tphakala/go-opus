// Transliteration of the DECODE side of silk/code_signs.c (libopus v1.6.1) for
// the frozen FIXED_POINT + DISABLE_FLOAT_API build: silk_decode_signs reads one
// range-coded sign bit for each nonzero pulse and attaches it to the (positive)
// pulse magnitudes produced by the shell decoder.
//
// The encode side (silk_enc_map / silk_encode_signs) is a phase-5 encoder
// concern and is omitted here. Names follow the C for diffability; silkSignICDF
// lives in tables_gen.go.
